# Introduction
All the source code from the battlefield 4 loadout generator web app is here.

it is still a work in progress. The name of the files are not reflecting the final result.
It is a lot of try an error for me as i'm a learning web developper.

This project is meanly for fun. Making somethiing usefull and learning something about it.

# How it works

The app is developped using the jquery library.
The main files are app.js the script used to fetch with ajax the data from the API and then analyses the data to randomise the loadouts.
The second one is router.js it is a simple script to create a simple single page application.

The main.css styles the app and is inspired of the battlelog web app style.
The style is mobile first and has 2 main brake points, one at 789px and the other at 1040px.
Phone, tablet and desktop.

# Credit

I would thank bf4stats for providing the API that made possible this app.
