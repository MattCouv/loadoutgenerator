    <h1>Hurra!</h1>
    <p>Soldier welcome to LoadoutGenerator.
      Here you will be able to generate some random loadouts
      for Battlefield 4 to mix things up and have some fun trying new ways to play.
    </p>
    <p>This little project is made possible thanks to the bf4stats
      API that provides you the hability to generate a random
      loadout with YOUR unlocks.
    </p>
    <p>This started as a side project to refresh my Battlefield 4 play times. While searching for a random generator on the internet I found nothing customized for me.</p>
    <p>I then took the initiative to use my skills in web developement to create a fully customized loadout generator for BF4.</p>
    <p>I really want to take this project further by including support for other games like Battlefront.</p>
    <p>Now go have fun in the Battlefield !</p>
